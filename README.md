This repository aims to propose my solutions to the exercises and the problems contained in the fabulous book "Learning from Data" by Yaser Abu-Mostafa et al. I will try to post solutions for each chapter as soon as I have them.

The solutions of the (programming) exercises are in R Markdown format, and the solutions of the problems are in R Markdown format and in PDF format as well.

Please feel free to comment and discuss if you feel I missed something or if I'm wrong of course.
